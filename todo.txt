Bugs/Todo
===================

Trying to add a newline seems to have caused a disconnect in the moveplayer and the textbox selection
- newlines should be allowed between existing lines

Invalid text is now black.

Rapidly clearing the entire textbox causes URL not to update

Try using properties to handle changes to twisty player rather than useEffect.
