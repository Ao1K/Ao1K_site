Bugs/Todo
===================


Need to be able to call commands like undo redo and 

Create a status string under moveHistory.current.status to avoid impossible combinations of states.

 - Caret node only tells where in textbox the undo/redo should snap the caret to. 
    That's it. This mentality can guide history-saving code.

If you change textbox selection from 0 to 1, but not caret selection of textbox 1 from last time that that textbox 1 was selected, then the move displayed on the cube won't changed
 - this happens because updates to move selection are pushed from within textbox. Since nothing has changed in textbox, no update pushed.
 - can fix this by forcing an update if the document textbox focus has changed
   - this causes issues where rerenders cause loss in caret position.
   - fixed via hack triggering the input handler
