After acception suggestion and deleting it, pressing tab doesn't do what you'd expect
  related? OnInputChange suggestion state = 'accepted' doesn't stick. Goes back to dismissed.

URL updating still removing scram

When pressing tab on non-empty line, send cube interpreter request as though current line is ''.
Then let MovesTextEditor handle showing any valid options.

Clean up colorDict and highlightClass being defined in multiple spots

Autocomplete for cross. Would need to brute force solutions to partial cross solution input. 
Or compute a bunch of crosses and just give whatever suggestion still works.
But we don't wanna just show autocomplete right away. Noisey.

Algs page. For your algs. A tab for your recons (click an icon and expand into a whole new page). A profile system. Oofda.

ZBLS autocomplete:
Case = f2l && (EO + AUF)
Noteably, adding U* to start of alg is still the same case.
So we generate a json specifically for ZBLS with these objects:
{hash: 'abcd', 'eoIndex': 9, alg: "R U R'"}
Then we search for hash matches only on f2l pieces. The EO is matched separately.
