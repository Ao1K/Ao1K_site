Informal Bugs/Todo List. Not guaranteed to be complete or accurate.
===================================================================

Screenshot scramble box shouldn't have 3-line minimum width, only 1 line.

Typing UU --> should make U2

Header can be regular element, not fixed. Not that deep.

stylized ' symbols should get autoreplaced with unstyled ' on paste. Similar for Uw --> u. 
  But this second one can be handled like UU --> U2
  Let's be limiting. Uw3 and similar should not convert at all.

Autocomplete for cross. Would need to brute force solutions to partial cross solution input. 
Or compute a bunch of crosses and just give whatever suggestion still works.
But we don't wanna just show autocomplete right away. Noisey.
  - Unless user requests it via tab!

Algs page. For your algs. A tab for your recons (click an icon and expand into a whole new page). A profile system. Oofda.

ZBLS autocomplete:
Case = f2l && (EO + AUF)
Noteably, adding U* to start of alg is still the same case.
So we generate a json specifically for ZBLS with these objects:
{hash: 'abcd', 'eoIndex': 9, alg: "R U R'"}
Then we search for hash matches only on f2l pieces. The EO is matched separately.
