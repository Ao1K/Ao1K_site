Hidden cube load safety and exception handling

Fix desync when rapidly accepting suggestions

Undo/redo doesn't restore caret position? Trouble reproducing.

Autocomplete for cross. Would need to brute force solutions to partial cross solution input. 
Or compute a bunch of crosses and just give whatever suggestion still works.
But we don't wanna just show autocomplete right away. Noisey.

Algs page. For your algs. A tab for your recons (click an icon and expand into a whole new page). A profile system. Oofda.

ZBLS autocomplete:
Case = f2l && (EO + AUF)
Noteably, adding U* to start of alg is still the same case.
So we generate a json specifically for ZBLS with these objects:
{hash: 'abcd', 'eoIndex': 9, alg: "R U R'"}
Then we search for hash matches only on f2l pieces. The EO is matched separately.


We have three things that need info on which step a line solves:
  1. Suggestion list popup
  2. Comment suggester
  3. Left side icon tray
#1 needs an updating list
#2 is easiest. We can just push a suggestion out when a step completes
#3 ideally needs a ground truth from a hidden cube ref

Since #1 largest requirements, makes sense to build an object around that and give the necessary info out to the other features.
So create a ref object that keeps and up-to-date list of steps solved on a line
But we should only give a comment suggestion when caret is in the right spot...
  So during the up-to-date event, we also send out the current line and move offset
  So what causes an up-to-date event?
  Probably just trackMoves. Ez.
  Can we keep a stable copy of allMoves for suggestion, so that we're sure the moves haven't changed since we started the suggestion process?




Flow of info 
0. interpretCurrentCubeState() constantly keeps the cube up to date
1a. user edits textbox
2a. if there no text in line, send a search request to cubeInterpreter, along with xy position of caret
3. cubeInterpreter returns suggestion
4. suggestionBox created, default selected
5. selected suggestion appears in grey text in textbox

2b. check if there's any suggestions in list that suggestionBox uses
3. filter to see if any suggestions still work
4. default suggestion shows up in grey still

1b. a step is newly completed via interpretCurrentCubeState()
2. suggested step names are passed to MovesTextEditor through an imperative ref
3. filter to see if any suggestions still work
4. default suggestion shows up in grey still
