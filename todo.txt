Fix selection bug when there's only one line of text (one div)

If user types "y ", don't show algs for "y' "

Make autocomplete auto-update its starting position if no step yet completed
 - This idea doesn't really work. We don't have a generalized autocompleter. 
 - We could, however, detect when cross is solved. Then make suggestion.
 - Ensure suggestion is not a direct undo of last few moves, 
    or at least that is solves more of cube.

Suggestions should support multislot icons:
Don't show suggestions that are direct longer version of other suggestion for same step.
 - Ex: R U R' U L U L' when R U R' solves FR.
    - Should only be rejected if R U R' U L U L' doesn't solve another slot as well.

Autocomplete for cross. Would need to brute force solutions to partial cross solution input. 
Or compute a bunch of crosses and just give whatever suggestion still works.
But we don't wanna just show autocomplete right away. Noisey.
  - Unless user requests it via tab!

  Properties of a cross algorithm
  - Moves should always move a layer that has a cross piece on it
  - Reward function should tell if cube is closer to being solved
    - Look at movecount remaining. Not that deep. Well wait, don't we want to follow a gradient?
  - Multiple solutions should be returned: ideally around 100
  - Cross solutions of 1-3+ moves should be a lookup table. Keep in mind multiple solutions exist (R2 L2 and L2 R2)
  


Algs page. For your algs. A tab for your recons (click an icon and expand into a whole new page). A profile system. Oofda.

ZBLS autocomplete:
Case = f2l && (EO + AUF)
Noteably, adding U* to start of alg is still the same case.
So we generate a json specifically for ZBLS with these objects:
{hash: 'abcd', 'eoIndex': 9, alg: "R U R'"}
Then we search for hash matches only on f2l pieces. The EO is matched separately.


Changes for verison 0.6?:
- Reduced page load times by about half
- Text substitutions (Uw -> u, UD -> (U D))
- Parens got getting colored
- Added about 700 f2l algs (counting variants as unique)
- Better colored previews, gave borders to icons. Unified style between preview and editor.
