Informal Bugs/Todo List. Not guaranteed to be complete or accurate.
===================================================================

Trying to add a newline seems to have caused a disconnect in the moveplayer and the textbox selection
- newlines should be allowed between existing lines

Rapidly clearing the entire textbox causes URL not to update
- having trouble reproducing

htmlUpdateMatrix is including html that did not update

start text: RUF \n LUF. Replace copy paste in LUF \n LUF instead. Timestamp snaps to end on 2nd line.
- having trouble reproducing

If textbox begins with an invalid character string (ex: ff) then rotation prefixing will fail and spans are not correctly parsed.

Encode "(" and ")". These characters can break "copy solve".

Adding a commented line or empty line can totally break the player after that line. Miscounted lines. 
I'm over-filtering out empty lines from the state variables. Need to handle them instead.

removing comment button is buggy and only removes comment text that is selected and not entire comment
